i'm living in that 21st century, doing something mean to it
do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
screams from the haters got a nice ring to it
i guess every superhero need his theme music


no one man should have all that power
the clock's ticking, i just count the hours
stop tripping, i'm tripping off the power



the system broken, the school's closed, the prison's open
we ain't got nothing to lose, motherfucker, we rolling
huh? motherfucker, we rolling
with some light-skinned girls and some kelly rowlands
in this white man world, we the ones chosen
so goodnight, cruel world, i'll see you in the morning
huh? i'll see you in the morning
this is way too much, i need a moment


no one man should have all that power
the clock's ticking, i just count the hours
stop tripping, i'm tripping off the power
'til then, fuck that, the world's ours
and they say, and they say
and they say, and they say
and they say, and they say



fuck snl and the whole cast
tell them yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
more specifically, they can kiss my asshole
i'm an asshole? you niggas got jokes
you short-minded niggas' thoughts is napoleon
my furs is mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
i embody every characteristic of the egotistic
he knows he's so fuckin' gifted
i just needed time alone with my own thoughts
got treasures in my mind, but couldn't open up my own vault
my childlike creativity, purity, and honesty
is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
reality is catching up with me
taking my inner child, i'm fighting for custody
with these responsibilities that they entrusted me
as i look down at my diamond-encrusted piece


thinking no one man should have all that power
the clock's ticking, i just count the hours
stop tripping, i'm tripping off the powder
'til then, fuck that, the world's ours
and they say, and they say
and they say, and they say
and they say, and they say



colin powells, austin powers
lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation
they say i was the abomination of obama's nation
well, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
at the end of the day, goddamned, i'm killing this shit
i know damn well y'all feeling this shit
i don't need your pussy, bitch, i'm on my own dick
i ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?
how ye doing? i'm survivin'
i was drinkin' earlier, now i'm drivin'
where the bad bitches, huh? where you hidin'?
i got the power make your life so excitin'


now this will be a beautiful death
i'm jumping out the window, i'm letting everything go
i'm letting everything go
mmm, now this will be a beautiful death
i'm jumping out the window, i'm letting everything go
i'm letting everything go
now this will be a beautiful death
jumping out the window, letting everything go
letting everything go
you got the power to let power go?
